Test cases

Imagine you just got a job with a MeasureIt.com. They want to create an app that measures everything. You'll need some methods that can return measurements.

Area should return the area of a rectangle
Perimeter should return the perimeter of a rectangle
Users should return an array of users
Should take a user name and return that user
You'll start by writing failing tests for these methods. Then write functions that make the tests pass.
